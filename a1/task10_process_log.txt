This file is where you will tell us details about the process you went through
in creating your project. This is where we want a record of your thoughts,
rough notes, failed attempts, things that you tried to get to work that didn't
work, etc. e.g. "My first step was to figure out what my main classes will be.
I figured out they were ... And then I tried to write code for ... This code
didn't work because ..."

You have two options for the format (you can also mix and match the two) -

(1)
A day-to-day journal format.

e.g.
On Friday, I tried to add [this feature].
I looked at [this website], which was helpful.
I managed to almost finish adding it, but [this went wrong].
I wanted to add it because [...], but decided not to in the end, because [...].
If I had more time, I would [...]

OR

(2)
Instead of dividing it up by days, you can divide it up
by task/feature.

e.g.
Task 1: Added New Monster
I tried to add this by [...]. What worked well was [...]
What didn't work the way I wanted it to was [...]

Task 2: Adding Invisible Treasure
I tried to add this by [...]. What worked well was [...]
What didn't work the way I wanted it to was [...]

===========================

YOUR LOG STARTS HERE

level 3:
a new map, the player needs to collect keys to open a lock then get to the door
there are devils in this level, the player cannot touch the devils

task 1: added new monster
added a new monster called devil, it is a subclass of monster
however, wasn't to sure what kind of rules i wanted for this level so decided
to make a map first

task 2: map
made a new map with 5 monsters placed inside
added key attribute to class Game (self.key keeps track of the numbers of the keys)
added class key under immobile objects, since key cannot move, it is similar to
 class Wall

task 3:
under import added "final_maze.txt" to LEVEL_MAPS
picked out icons for devil, lock, and key
finished setup_current_level to make level 3
level 3 is a combination of the previous 2 levels, instead of random 7 stars,
there are 4 keys, the devil in level 3 has the same movement as the squishy monster

task 4:
problem: after testing a few times, one of the keys randomly appeared inside the
box and is not reachable since the lock is blocking the way
changed the map to solve the problem

task 5:
added code in player.move so the player wont go through the lock and if the player
wants to go through the lock before collecting all the keys, a message will be printed
to the console saying to collect all keys

task 6:
game.game_won, added code for the player to win the game (win level 3)

task 7:
the game is playable, so i tried to polish all my code
